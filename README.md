# KNN-LM at scale
This repository is based on [neulab/knn-transformers](https://github.com/neulab/knn-transformers) repositoty and contains the implementation or [knn-lm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00172).

This repository extends [neulab/knn-transformers](https://github.com/neulab/knn-transformers) in several ways:
1. Support for quantized llama models
2. Support for using large datasets in knn-lm, namely saving faiss index in batches

Otherwise, the library works exactly as [neulab/knn-transformers](https://github.com/neulab/knn-transformers). For more information, contact their repository.
